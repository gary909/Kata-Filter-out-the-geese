    <h1>Kata: Filter out the geese</h1>
    <h2>Open the console...</h2>

    <p>
      Write a function, gooseFilter / goose-filter / goose_filter / GooseFilter,
      that takes an <br />
      array of strings as an argument and returns a filtered array containing
      the same elements <br />
      but with the 'geese' removed.<br />
      <br />
      The geese are any strings in the following array, which is pre-populated
      in your solution:<br />
      <br />
      geese = ["African", "Roman Tufted", "Toulouse", "Pilgrim",
      "Steinbacher"]<br />
      For example, if this array were passed as an argument:<br />
      <br />
      ["Mallard", "Hook Bill", "African", "Crested", "Pilgrim", "Toulouse",
      "Blue Swedish"]<br />
      Your function would return the following array:<br />
      <br />
      ["Mallard", "Hook Bill", "Crested", "Blue Swedish"]<br />
      The elements in the returned array should be in the same order as in the
      initial array <br />
      passed to your function, albeit with the 'geese' removed. Note that all of
      the strings <br />
      will be in the same case as those provided, and some elements may be
      repeated.<br />
